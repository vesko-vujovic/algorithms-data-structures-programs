# Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs


In this Repository I wanted to refresh my mind about 'REAL' programming, and how it was hard back then to program, when you didn't had 
any library and api's. In order to solve a problem you had to be conscious about every byte you spend. 


I will finish this README with two quotes from my favorite computer scientists.


“The belief that complex systems require armies of designers and programmers is wrong. A system that is not understood in its entirety, or at least to a significant degree of detail by a single individual, should probably not be built.” - Niklaus Wirth


"If you optimize everything, you will always be unhappy." - Donald E Knuth
